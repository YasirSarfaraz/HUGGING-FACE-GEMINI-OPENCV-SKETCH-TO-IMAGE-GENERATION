# UNDER DEVELOPMENT

The project is still in progress there are many things to Add and modify.
This is not the final solution.

# Image-Generation-GenAI-OpenCV

This project is an AI-powered image generation tool that uses OpenCV for webcam input and drawing, Streamlit for the user interface, and Hugging Face's Stable Diffusion model for generating images based on user drawings. Leverages Google's Gemini AI to generate the prompts from the user drawing.

## Features

- **Webcam Integration**: Capture video input from your webcam.
- **Drawing Canvas**: Draw on a canvas and generate images based on the drawing.
- **Text Input**: Generate images based on the generated prompt from the images.
- **AI Image Generation**: Uses Hugging Face's Stable Diffusion model to generate images.
- **Streamlit Interface**: User-friendly interface built with Streamlit.
